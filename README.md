# SystemInfo

Tool for when your friends or family says "help my computers busted" and you want to run through the default checklist of drivers etc.

Also could be used to get specs of a machine your handed. Written in go because duh, also its fun and multi-OS.

Outputs `table`, `json` or `yaml` - so easy to lookat or parse.

# Roadmap

Plan on adding a bootstrapper. A [`dotfiles`](https://github.com/benbentwo/dotfiles) replacement / supplement that will install based.

Plan on improving [`system_profiler`](https://github.com/benbentwo/system_profiler) for this repo to better support **darwin**

Plan on adding driver checker (**windows**)
